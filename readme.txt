This is a simple opensource Wordpress plugin which adds possibility to create simple, categorizable gallery images into your Wordpress website. Its aim is to be lightweight developer-friendly plugin.

There are lot of plugins which are providing the same functionality... However also another complex functionality, which is not needed. Imagine scenario when you need a bannana, but you are using plugin which ships with gorilla holding it and whole jungle included.

Feel Free to contribute. Any attemts to improve this plugin or make it more generic are welcome.

Philosophy is to made this plugin with as less dependencies as possible. Keep that in mind please.
